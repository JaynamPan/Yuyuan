# Build Notes

- This project configures repository mirrors in settings.gradle.kts and
  gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.properties, in case for internet issues.
- Inside gradle.properties, the gradle is set to be able to use 5GB RAM at most, adjust it according
  to your local machine.
- Inside gradle.properties, both configuration cache and build cache are enabled to speed up build
  process. Adjust the settings if you have incompatible issues and clear caches if it's corrupted.
